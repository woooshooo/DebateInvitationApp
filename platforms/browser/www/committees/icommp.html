              <p>The <b>Institutional Communications and Promotions</b> (from hereon known as iCOMMP) is an office under the Office of the President that caters to the needs of the university to produce multimedia collaterals to promote its core values as well as its advocacies.</p>

              <p>We support and promote the school’s various advocacies by creating print and digital materials to supplement it. We also document each advocacy event through video, and photo, making sure that every moment is captured with clarity. Lastly, we spread the word through AdDU’s official social media accounts.</p>

              <p>We work with offices and individuals to create their needs such as videos, logos, and other promotional materials. However, we also have our own projects that, despite being fun, still align with the values and advocacies of the school.</p>

              <p>We hope to inspire the youth by sharpening their creative skills to better help the community, especially Mindanao, through our volunteer pool ⏤ COMMS. We hope to train young creatives through workshops, conventions, seminars, and hands-on field training. Training then spiritually, socially, and technically will allow these volunteers to better communicate the message of the university and be leaders for Mindanao.</p>
